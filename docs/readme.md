# Event-Driven Architectures in Pharo

PharoEDA is a framework that simplifies developing Event-Driven Architectures [1].
It's also an opinionated framework favoring Domain-Driven Design [2], which means that if you honor some conventions, and the adapters are available, PharoEDA will let you focus in your domain and only in your domain. It works out-of-the-box. Please read on even if your programming language of choice is not Pharo Smalltalk [3].

## It works Out-of-the-box

PharoEDA has adapters for RabbitMQ [4] and MongoDB [5] (through Voyage [6]).
